import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<h2 id="get-started">Install</h2>

Install the package via your package manager of choice.

<Tabs syncKey="packageManager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh
  npm i stepper-hook
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add stepper-hook
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm add stepper-hook
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Usage

To create a stepper, use the `<Stepper>` component. The
only required prop is `steps`, which is an array of React
components that represent each step.

<Aside>
Notice that the step components can't accept any props, if you
need to pass data to the steps use the `useStepper` hook `data`
property.
</Aside>

```tsx
import { Stepper } from 'stepper-hook'

const steps = [
  WelcomeStep,
  Step2,
  Step3,
]

const App = () => (
  <Stepper steps={steps} />
)
```

## Step Component

Steps are standard React components, they are isolated from
the stepper and can contain anthything you want:

```tsx
const WelcomeStep = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to stepper-hook</h2>
    <p>React hook for creating custom stepper components</p>
  </div>
)
```

## Step Navigation

The navigation may be controlled by the a common component,
like the footer with directional arrow used in the above example or by the
steps themselves. Or both.

### By the stepper

```tsx
function StepperFooter() {
  const { isFirstStep, isLastStep, goToNextStep, goToPreviousStep } = useStepper()

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'space-between',
      }}
    >
      <button
        disabled={isFirstStep}
        onClick={goToPreviousStep}
      >
        Back
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={goToNextStep}
      >
        {isLastStep ? 'Done' : 'Next'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then place the footer component inside the `<Stepper>` component,
this is very important because the footer uses React Context to
communicate with the stepper:

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Stepper steps={steps}>
      <StepperFooter />
    </Stepper>
  </div>
)
```

### By the step

You can also control the navigation from the steps themselves,
this is useful when you don't want to use a common footer component
or when you want to add custom navigation logic to a specific step.

In this case you don't need any component inside the `<Stepper>`,
just use the `useStepper` hook inside the step component:

```tsx
const Step2 = () => {
  const { goToNextStep } = useStepper()

  const handleAnswer = (event) => {
    const answer = event.target.textContent
    saveAnswer(answer)
    goToNextStep()
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>What's your role in the company?</h2>
      <button onClick={handleAnswer}>Manager</button>
      <button onClick={handleAnswer}>Developer</button>
      <button onClick={handleAnswer}>Marketing</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
